# Tabletop Simulator Lua Script

## Introduction

This Lua script enhances Tabletop Simulator's functionality for objects tagged with "Thoughtform." It introduces features such as automatic scaling, health point management, stall and equip controls, zone-based rotations, and duplicate placement. Visit [dimensionbeyond.space](https://dimensionbeyond.space) for more insights.

## Features

### Scaling Objects
Objects tagged "Thoughtform" automatically scale up for improved visibility on the table.

### Health Points Counter
Buttons on "Thoughtform" objects enable easy adjustment and display of health points.

### Stall and Equip Buttons
Toggle between "Ready" and "Stall" states, manage equipment, and cycle through different equipment states with dedicated buttons.

### Zone Rotation
Objects align their rotation based on player colors when entering specific zones.

### Duplicate Placement
Pick up objects with specific component tags face up, and the script creates duplicates arranged in a grid around the original object's position. Dropping the object destroys the duplicates.

## Usage

### Scaling
Place objects with the "Thoughtform" tag on the table for automatic scaling.

### Health Points
Click the plus and minus buttons to adjust health points. The "HP" button displays current health points.

### Stall and Equip
Use the "S T A L L" button to toggle between "Ready" and "Stall" states. The "N OÂ E Q U I P" button manages equipment, cycling through different states.

### Zone Rotation
Objects rotate based on their player color when entering specific zones.

### Duplicate Placement
Pick up objects face up with specific component tags to create duplicates around the original position. Dropping the object destroys the duplicates.
